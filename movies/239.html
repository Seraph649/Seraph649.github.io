                    <span class="actor-name">Paul Rudd</span>
                    <span class="character-name">I went into this flick not expecting much. I'm not an Ant Man fan so I was not waiting in anticipation for this as much as I wanted to see Age of Ultron. The character that Paul Rudd plays in this movie is not the Ant Man I wanted to see, and Micheal Douglas' role as Hank Pym, the original Ant man only made me want to see him dawn the suit even more, cause Micheal Douglas was everything a superhero should be in this movie, Charming, really good dialog, and ready for action. Overall, Ant Man surprised me. It was one of the more unique superhero movies out. Ant Man did things far beyond just punching and kicking that a lot of superheroes are doing on the big screen and went places no other super hero could go making for an action packed adventure. As cool as Ant Man was when he was regular size beating up the bad guys, was as good as when he was shrunken, riding and controlling ants in a world only he can go to. The villain Darren Cross was actually pretty good too. Not as good as Loki, but just as psycho. Once again, not an Ant Man fan but this movie is changing my mind. I'm so impressed with what Paul Rudd did with the character. Not only that, but it's a great Marvel comic movie, in how it intertwines with the whole Marvel cinematic Universe. Definitely recommend seeing in 3D cause it's that type of movie that deserves it.</span>
